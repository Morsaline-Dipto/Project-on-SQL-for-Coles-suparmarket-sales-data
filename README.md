This project is on coles supermarket sales data. The dataset used for this project is collected from Kaggle.
Disclaimer: This is not any offical sales report/analysis. This data analysis is only done to demonstrate SQL skills and practice.
For this project, I have collected my dataset from kaggle and imported in SQL. I have done my analysis using SQL query. I have collected my analysis and presented them in excel file.
I have used SQL Joins, Window function, CTE, sub-Query to analyze my data.
Few highlights are revenue target, best revenue generating store/state, State wise breakdown of data, Customer and Staff number and many more.
